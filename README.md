## Auto-Southwest Check-In
Running this script will automatically check you into your flight 24 hours beforehand. Additionally,
the script can notify you if the price of your flight drops before departure
(see [Fare Check](CONFIGURATION.md#fare-check)).

This script can also log in to your Southwest account and automatically schedule check-ins as
flights are scheduled.

**Note**: If you are checking into an international flight, make sure to fill out all the passport
information beforehand.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.7+][0]
- [Pip][1]
- [Any Chromium-based browser][2]

First, download the script onto your computer
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in.git
cd auto-southwest-check-in
```
Then, install the needed packages for the script
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may want to install the requirements in a [Python virtual environment][3] to ensure they don't conflict
with other Python projects on your system.

### Upgrading
When updating the script, it is important to follow the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for any actions
that need to be performed.

To get the script's current version, run the following command:
```shell
python3 southwest.py --version
```

To update the script, simply run:
```shell
git pull
```

## Using the Script
To schedule a check-in, run the following command:
```shell
python3 southwest.py CONFIRMATION_NUMBER FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME
```
Alternatively, you can log in to your account, which will automatically check you in to all of your flights
```shell
python3 southwest.py USERNAME PASSWORD
```
**Note**: If any arguments contain special characters, make sure to escape them so they are passed into
the script correctly.

For the full usage of the script, run:
```shell
python3 southwest.py --help
```

**Note**: The script will check the entire party in under the same reservation, so there is no need
to create more than one instance of the script per reservation.

If you want the latest features of the script, you can use the `develop` branch (documented changes
can be viewed in the Changelog). However, keep in mind that changes to this branch do not ensure reliability.

### Running in Docker
The application can also be run in a container using [Docker][4]. The Docker repository for this project
can be found [here][5]. To pull the latest image, run:
```shell
docker pull jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in
```
To download a specific version, append `:vX.X` to the end of the image name. You can also append the
`:develop` tag instead to use the latest development version.

To run the image, you can use a command such as:
```shell
docker run -d jdholtz/auto-southwest-check-in ARGS
```
See above for the arguments that can be passed in. You can optionally attach a configuration file to the container
by adding the `--volume /path/to/config.json:/app/config.json` flag before the image name.

**Note**: The recommended restart policy for the container is `on-failed` or `no`

Additional information on the Docker container can be found in the [public repository][5].

## Configuration
To use the default configuration file, copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`.

For information on how to set up the configuration, see [Configuration.md](CONFIGURATION.md)

**Note**: If you are using Docker, make sure to rebuild the container after editing the configuration
file for your changes to be applied.

## Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot a problem, run the script with the `--verbose` flag. This will display debug messages so you can
get a better overview of the problem.

If you run into any issues, please file it via [GitHub Issues][6]. Please attach any relevant logs (found in
`logs/auto-southwest-check-in.log`) to the issue. The logs should not have any personal information but check to make
sure before attaching it.

If you have any questions or discussion topics, start a [GitHub Discussion][7].
